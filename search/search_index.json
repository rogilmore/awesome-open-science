Wikipedia definition UNESCO Recommendatio non Open Science UNESCO Definition Open Science Manifesto Six Pillars of Open Science Open methodology Open Source Software Open Data Open Access Open Peer Review Open Educational Resources How do you define reproducible science? Reproducibility and Replicability in Science by The National Academies 2019 National Academies Report 2019 Reproducibility means computational reproducibility\u2014obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis. Replicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data. Reproducibility vs Replicability by Plesser (2018) In Reproducibility vs. Replicability , Hans Plesser gives the following useful definitions: Repeatability (Same team, same experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by the same team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that a researcher can reliably repeat her own computation. Replicability (Different team, same experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using the author\u2019s own artifacts. Reproducibility (Different team, different experimental setup): The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artifacts which they develop completely independently. The paper goes on to further simplify: Methods reproducibility : provide sufficient detail about procedures and data so that the same procedures could be exactly repeated. Results reproducibility : obtain the same results from an independent study with procedures as closely matched to the original study as possible. Inferential reproducibility : draw the same conclusions from either an independent replication of a study or a reanalysis of the original study. How many pillars of Open Science Are There?
