The FAIR acronym and principles were defined in a March 2016 paper in the journal Scientific Data by a consortium of scientists and organizations

[Wilkinson et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18){target=_blank} established the guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) of digital assets for research.

[Carroll et al. (2020)](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-043){target=_blank} established the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.

## Non-Profit Code Repositories

[EDUAT](https://www.eudat.eu/){target=_blank} – network of European research organizations.

[Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/){target=_blank} – offers free storage of research data, owned by Harvard

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/){target=_blank} – EU-funded project by ApenAire, it is hosted by CERN. Useful for EU-funded projects because reports back to the EU research Participant Portal.

[Dryad](https://datadryad.org){target=_blank} – started as US NSF project, used for data sets of any type that correspond to a research paper.
